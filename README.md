# Awesome-Sensing-Tech
With increasing interest in new sensing technology, a curated list of the common sensing tech for HCI research is created, by the category of general sensing principles.
The goals of this curation are to:
* Allow new HCI researchers to quickly understand the existing sensing technology
* Lower the barrier of prototyping a sensing technology for HCI research

## MmWave (frequency between 30G Hz and 300G HZ)
mmWave is an extremely valuable sensing technology for detection of objects and providing the range, velocity and angle of these objects. It is a contactless-technology which operates in the spectrum between 30GHz and 300GHz. Due to the technologyâ€™s use of small wavelengths it can provide sub-mm range accuracy and is able to penetrate certain materials such as plastic, drywall, clothing, and is impervious to environmental conditions such as rain, fog, dust and snow.
