# Awesome-Sensing-Tech
With an increasing interest in emerging sensing technology, we created an awesome curated list to understand how recent researchers weave sensing technology into user interfaces. 
Also, we included several background resources and codes to lower the learning barrier for research beginners.
This curation is currently categorized by the general sensing principle.

## Resistive Sensing
Resistive sensing is to detect the resistance change caused by the change in length, area, or material of conductors, usually implemented with a voltage divider or Wheatstone bridge. The common sensors include force sensor, strain gauge, ambient light sensor, resistive touch screen and etc.

## Capacitive Sensing
Capacitive sensing basically detects the charge change stored in two conductors, which could be triggered by the change of electrical field, the approach of a new conductor (e.g. human body), the variance in dielectrics among the conductors, or the distance change between the conductors. Its implementation is usually with a RC circuit or a LC tank. It can be used to sense the hand gestures, proximity, pressure, position, force, humidity, and fluid level.

## Inductive Sensing
Inductive sensing is based on the principle of magnetic induction to detect nearby metallic objects. It is usually implemented by a coil, which acts as an inductor to generate a high frequency magnetic field. If there is a metal object near the changing magnetic field, current will flow in the object an form a new magnetic field that opposes the original magnetic field. The net effect would cause the change in the inductance of the coil, resulting in the change of the resonant frequnecy in the LC tank. The technology enables precise measurement of linear and angular position, displacement, motion, compression, vibration, and metal composition.

## Impedance Sensing
Impedance is the measure of the opposition that a circuit presents to a current when a voltage is applied. Impedance sensing is based on the fact that a grounded object, such as human body, will shunt some current to ground when it encounters an electric field through capacitive coupling. It is usually implemented by adding a relatively small AC current between a pair of electrodes, creating an electric field in the conductive medium. When a grounded object influenced the electric field, the impedance between the pair of electrode will change accordingly.
