# Awesome-Sensing-Tech
With an increasing interest in emerging sensing technology, we created an awesome curated list to understand how recent researchers weave sensing technology into user interfaces. 
Also, we included several background resources and codes to lower the learning barrier for research beginners.
This curation is currently categorized by the general sensing principle.

## Resistive Sensing
Resistive sensing is to detect the resistance change caused by the change in length, area, or material of conductors, usually implemented with a voltage divider or Wheatstone bridge. The common sensors include force sensor, strain gauge, ambient light sensor, resistive touch screen and etc.
