# Awesome-Sensing-Tech
With increasing interest in new sensing technology, a curated list of the common sensing tech for HCI research is created, by the category of general sensing principles.
The goals of this curation are to:
* Allow new HCI researchers to quickly understand the existing sensing technology
* Lower the barrier of prototyping a sensing technology for HCI research

## MmWave ()
mmWave is an extremely valuable sensing technology for detection of objects and providing the range, velocity and angle of these objects. It is a contactless-technology which operates in the spectrum between 30GHz and 300GHz. Due to the technologyâ€™s use of small wavelengths it can provide sub-mm range accuracy and is able to penetrate certain materials such as plastic, drywall, clothing, and is impervious to environmental conditions such as rain, fog, dust and snow.
